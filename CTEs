Answer questions using CTEs instead of subqueries.

Average amount paid by top 5 customers:

WITH top_five_customers_cte (customer_ID, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id,
        A.first_name, 
        A.last_name, 
        C.city,
        D.country,
        SUM(E.amount)
 FROM customer A
 INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
 INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
 INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
 INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
 WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
 GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country 
 ORDER BY SUM(amount)DESC
 LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average 
FROM top_five_customers_cte

How many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

WITH all_customer_count_cte (all_customer_count, country) AS 
(SELECT COUNT(A.customer_id),
        D.country 
 FROM customer A
 INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
 INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
 INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
 GROUP BY D.country),
top_customer_count_cte (country, top_customer_count) AS 
(SELECT country,
        COUNT(country) AS top_customer_count
 FROM
      (SELECT A.customer_id AS Customer_ID,
              A.first_name AS Customer_First_Name, 
              A.last_name AS Customer_Last_Name, 
              C.city AS City,
              D.country AS Country,
              SUM(E.amount) AS Total_Amount_Paid 
       FROM customer A
       INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
       INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
       INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
       INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
       WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur') 
       GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country 
       ORDER BY SUM(amount)DESC
       LIMIT 5) AS top_five_customers
  GROUP BY country)
SELECT all_customer_count_cte.country, all_customer_count, top_customer_count 
FROM all_customer_count_cte
LEFT JOIN top_customer_count_cte ON all_customer_count_cte.country = top_customer_count_cte.country
