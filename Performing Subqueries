Step 1: Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

INNER:
(SELECT A.customer_id AS Customer_ID, 
        A.first_name AS Customer_First_Name, 
        A.last_name AS Customer_Last_Name, 
        C.city AS City,
        D.country AS Country,
        SUM(E.amount) AS Total_Amount_Paid 
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country 
ORDER BY SUM(amount)DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid

OUTER:
SELECT AVG(amount)
FROM payment 

COMBINED:
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average 
FROM
  (SELECT A.customer_id AS Customer_ID, 
        A.first_name AS Customer_First_Name,
        A.last_name AS Customer_Last_Name,

FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country 
ORDER BY SUM(amount)DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_five_customers


Step 2: Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country.

CALCULATING NUMBER of CUSTOMERS PER COUNTRY - all_customer_count → TABLE A

(SELECT
        COUNT(A.customer_id) AS All_customer_count, D.country
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
GROUP BY D.country) AS table_a

CALCULATING top_customer_count → TABLE B

(SELECT country,
        COUNT(country) AS top_customer_count
FROM (SELECT A.customer_id AS Customer_ID, 
             A.first_name AS Customer_First_Name, 
             A.last_name AS Customer_Last_Name,
             C.city AS City,
             D.country AS Country,
             SUM(E.amount) AS Total_Amount_Paid
      FROM customer A
        INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
        INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
        INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
        INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
        WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
        GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country 
        ORDER BY SUM(amount)DESC
        LIMIT 5) AS top_five_customers
GROUP BY country) AS table_b

FINAL QUERY:

       table_a.all_customer_count, 
       table_b.top_customer_count
